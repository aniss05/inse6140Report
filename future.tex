\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
  \paragraph{}
   As a conclusion to this project, we can say that it was a quite challenging and interesting work which helped us to learn a lot of new concepts and to improve our programming capabilities in Swift, Java, and XML. Puzzlr certainly offers strong and secure images exchange between different clients, however, there are some missing parts that we did not address yet like the cross-platform concept, certificate management, and real world deployement.
   \paragraph{}
   For now the two implementations work only if the two clients use the same platform, in other words, if Alice is using Puzzlr IOS version, she can only communicate with Bob if this one is using the same IOS. The second limitation is that we need to implement a platform for OpenSSL certificates distribution between different clients, and finally, we need to find a permanent server, like a dedicated server to host the server-side implementation.
