\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
  \paragraph{}
   Puzzlr was a quite challenging and interesting work which helped us to learn a lot of new concepts and to improve our programming skills. Puzzlr offers strong and secure images exchange between different clients, however, there are some missing parts that we did not address yet like the cross-platform compatibility, certificate distribution between nodes, and threat modeling (you can find a draft on a Puzzlr's Microsoft Threat Model in the Github in the ``Docs" directory).
   \paragraph{}
   For now, the two implementations work only if the two clients use the same platform, in other words, if Alice is using Puzzlr IOS version, she can only communicate with Bob if this one is using the same IOS.
   \paragraph{}
   We released our software under MIT License because we believe that the developper community can modify it and enhance it in order to make it more secure and reliable.
   In the future, once we are sure that Puzzlr offers a decent level of security, we might plan to deploy the backend on different servers around the world and released the apps on their respective store.
